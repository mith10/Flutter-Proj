## About the Project

Unique Solutions previously managed registrations and transactions manually, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. An app was needed to efficiently make entries and perform searches to automate and streamline this process. This project addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive solution for managing records, tracking transactions, and visualizing data.

## Features

### 1. Add Record
This feature allows users to add a new record with the following details:
- **Name:** The name of the individual or entity.
- **Category:** The category of the item (e.g., gloves or cotton).
- **Quantity:** The number of items.
- **Weight:** The weight of the items.
- **Price:** The price per unit.
- **Total Price:** The total price is calculated based on the quantity and price per unit.

### 2. Search for a Particular Record
Users can search for a specific record and perform various actions:
- **View Record:** See the details of the record.
- **Add Payment Amounts:** Add payments to the record.
- **Add Bills:** Attach bills to the record.

### 3. Transaction History
This feature provides a detailed history of all transactions related to a particular record. Users can view the amount, description, date, and time of each transaction.

### 4. Statistics
The app provides statistics on amounts paid, remaining, and total amounts in both pie chart and tabular form. This helps users get a clear overview of their financial status at a glance.
